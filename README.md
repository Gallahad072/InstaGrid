# InstaCollage

I wanted something that could make a collage of an instagram account's pictures so I could make a poster of [OpenAi's](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) Dalle 2 [creations](https://www.instagram.com/openaidalle/).

This [program](main.py) will make a landscape or portrait collage of any Instagram account you can access to be used as a phone or computer wallpaper.
